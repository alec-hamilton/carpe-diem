# CarPe-Diem
A app to display a collection of cars.

## Description
CarPe-Diem is an object-oriented PHP project, styled with SASS, that fetches and displays information about different cars from a MySQL database.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo:

```bash
git@github.com:iO-Academy/2022-mar-carcollection.git
```
Navigate into the newly created repo:

```bash
cd 2022-mar-carcollection
```

Run this to install auto-load:

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

Create a MySQL database called:

```bash
carsdb
```

Ensure your local database details match the following: 

```bash

Open `initialisation.php` in a browser, this will create and fill database tables.

Run `index.php` to see the application!
