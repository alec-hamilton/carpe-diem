# CarPe-Diem
An app to display a collection of cars.

## Description
CarPe-Diem is an object-oriented PHP project, styled with SASS, that fetches and displays information about different cars from a MySQL database.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo:

```bash
git@github.com:iO-Academy/2022-mar-carcollection.git
```
Navigate into the newly created repo:

```bash
cd 2022-mar-carcollection
```

Run this to initialise SASS:

```bash
sass --watch style.scss style.css
```

Install the database `/XXXXXXXXX.sql` into a db named `XXXXXXXX`

Ensure your local database host, username and password details are correct in:

```bash
XXX
```

The application will now be available wherever you access your PHP prejects :-)
